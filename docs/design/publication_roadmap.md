# PowerGrid 2.0: Publication Roadmap

**Strategic Plan for Submission-Ready Research Paper**

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 2025
**Target**: Top-tier venue acceptance by June 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a **6-month execution plan** to transform PowerGrid 2.0 from a design proposal into a **publication-ready research contribution** acceptable at top AI/systems conferences.

**Key Insight**: Current proposal = engineering design document. Target venue = research paper with experiments, insights, and reproducible benchmarks.

---

## Current State Assessment

### What We Have ✅
- Solid architectural design (agents, multi-agent env, hierarchical control)
- Clear vision for plug-and-play extensibility
- 3-month implementation roadmap
- Component diagrams and design documentation

### Critical Gaps ❌
- **No working implementation** (only 3-month roadmap)
- **No experiments** (no baselines, no learning curves, no results)
- **No datasets** (CAISO/ERCOT mentioned but not integrated)
- **No novel research insights** (architectural proposals ≠ research findings)
- **No baseline comparisons** (need MPC, OPF, 5+ RL algorithms)
- **Wrong paper structure** (50 pages design vs. 15 pages experiments)

**Verdict**: Not submittable to any top-tier venue in current form.

## Lessons from Successful Papers

### Case Study 1: CityLearn (BuildSys 2019 → NeurIPS Competition)

**Trajectory**:
1. **2019**: 2-page demo at BuildSys (systems venue, tool paper)
2. **2020**: Benchmarking study at RLEM workshop (experiments added)
3. **2020+**: NeurIPS official competition track (community adoption)

**Key Success Factors**:
- Started with **working implementation** at submission
- **Real datasets**: 9 buildings × 4 climates × 8760 hours = 315K data points
- **Baselines comparison**: RBC, SAC, PPO, QMIX, MADDPG (10 seeds each)
- **Novel insight**: "Independent learners competitive with complex MARL"
- **Systems venue first**, then ML venues

---

### Case Study 2: SustainGym (NeurIPS 2023 Datasets & Benchmarks)

**What They Did**:
- **5 diverse environments**: EV charging, HVAC, data centers, carbon-aware compute, battery
- **8 baselines**: SAC, TD3, PPO, A2C, IPPO, MAPPO, RBC, MPC
- **Rigorous evaluation**: 5 seeds, learning curves, ablations, distribution shift analysis
- **Novel insight**: "Off-the-shelf RL fails on sustainability (18-35% performance drop on unseen data)"
- **Paper structure**: 15 pages experiments, 4 pages env description, 2 pages intro

**Why It Succeeded**:
- Working package (pip install sustaingym)
- Comprehensive benchmarks with statistical rigor
- Identified clear research gap (generalization failure)
- 200+ training runs documented

## Key Research Insights (To Be Discovered)

**These are hypotheses to test during experiments**:

### Hypothesis 1: Scalability
> "Hierarchical MARL scales to 100+ agents while centralized methods fail beyond 20 agents due to exponential action space growth."

**Evidence needed**:
- Plot: Training time vs # agents (centralized exponential, hierarchical linear)
- Plot: Final performance vs # agents (centralized plateaus/degrades, hierarchical maintains)
- Table: Memory usage (centralized OOM at N=25, hierarchical works at N=100)

---

### Hypothesis 2: Communication Efficiency
> "Voltage-weighted communication reduces bandwidth by 90% while retaining 95% of performance compared to full communication."

**Evidence needed**:
- Ablation: no comm (70% performance), local (85%), global (100%), weighted (95%)
- Plot: Performance vs communication budget (show Pareto frontier)
- Table: Messages sent per step (global=N², weighted=N/10)

---

### Hypothesis 3: Hierarchy Depth
> "Two-level hierarchy is optimal: flat fails to coordinate, three-level adds overhead without benefit."

**Evidence needed**:
- Comparison: flat (fails on 50+ agents), 2-level (best performance), 3-level (slower convergence)
- Figure: Convergence speed vs hierarchy depth (inverted U-shape)

---

| **CAISO data access issues** | Low | Medium | Use synthetic data as fallback (load_profiles library) |
| **Baselines crash on 100 agents** | Medium | High | Reduce to 50 agents for centralized, highlight as limitation |
| **e-Energy deadline miss** | Low | Critical | Weekly checkpoints, buffer 2 weeks before deadline |
| **GPU availability** | Medium | High | Reserve cloud credits early, use preemptible instances |
| **Scope creep** | High | High | **Strict feature freeze after Month 2** |

### Contingency Plan

**If behind schedule by end of Month 3**:

**Priority 1 (Must Have for e-Energy)**:
- ✅ 3 baseline algorithms (PPO, MAPPO, MPC)
- ✅ 3 benchmark tasks (voltage, dispatch, scalability)
- ✅ Main results table + 3 learning curves

**Priority 2 (Should Have)**:
- ⚠️ 5 baselines (defer OPF, SAC if needed)
- ⚠️ Ablation studies (communication only, skip hierarchy depth)

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have - Defer to NeurIPS)**:
- ❌ Distribution shift analysis
- ❌ Transfer learning study
- ❌ GNN policies

## Expected Reviewer Feedback & Responses

### After e-Energy Submission (Feb 2026)

**Likely Positive Comments**:
> "Well-designed benchmark with comprehensive evaluation. The scalability study is valuable for the community."

> "Real-world datasets and classical baselines (MPC, OPF) make this practical. Reproducibility package is excellent."

**Likely Critical Comments**:
> "Why only voltage regulation? Real grids have frequency control, protection, etc."

**Response Strategy**:
- Acknowledge limitation in discussion section
- Argue: voltage/dispatch are primary use cases for RL (frequency = milliseconds, out of scope)
- Promise future work on dynamic control

---

> "Hierarchical method is just parameter sharing. What's novel?"

**Response Strategy**:
- Emphasize: novel contribution is benchmark + baselines, not algorithm
- H-MAPPO is ablation to show hierarchy helps, not claimed as novel algorithm
- If reviewer insists: add voltage-weighted communication as novel coordination mechanism

---

> "Only 5 seeds? Standard is 10+ for RL."

**Response Strategy**:
- Acknowledge, run 5 more seeds in rebuttal period (2 weeks)
- Update figures with 10 seeds
- Cite computational cost (800 GPU-hours already)

---
