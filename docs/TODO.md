Key Architecture Points:
Setup Phase (Top Half):
Device Creation: Each power system component (DG, ESS, RES, Shunt) is instantiated as an autonomous agent with:
state: Current operating point (P, Q, SOC, etc.)
action: Action space definition (continuous/discrete ranges)
Internal logic for translating actions → physics
Environment Assembly: GridBaseEnv acts as the coordinator agent that:
Owns the devices OrderedDict (registry of sub-agents)
Builds combined action/observation spaces
Manages the pandapower network (physics backend)
Runtime Phase (Bottom Half) - Single env.step():
Action Distribution (steps 1-2): RL algorithm provides flattened action vector → Environment slices it by device
Parallel Sub-Agent Execution (step 3): Each device agent processes its action slice:
DG.update_state(): Converts action to power setpoint
ESS.update_state(): Updates power + SOC dynamics
Shunt.update_state(): Discrete switching logic
Physics Synchronization (step 4-5): Device states pushed to pandapower → power flow solved
Reward Computation (steps 6-8): Each agent calculates local cost/safety → coordinator aggregates
Feedback Loop (steps 9-10): Return to RL algorithm
Hierarchical Structure:
Level 1: GridBaseEnv = Grid-level coordinator
Level 2: Individual Device objects = Component-level agents
Level 3 (potential): Multiple GridBaseEnv instances = Multi-microgrid agents
